# Simple-Damage-Tracking

This is a very basic damage tracking system put together to track losses related to my ebay business.
It allows for entry of return/damaged product type losses as well as general warehouse losses.

There are two versions. The python version has been in use by a small team. The Vue version is currently in development as a replacement.
